# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links
I deployed this completed challenge on Netlify:
https://sunnyside-agency-landingpage.netlify.app/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3, Flexbox, Grid
- Bootstrap 5
- Firefox developer tools


### What I learned
This challenge was perfect for practicing CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. I used Bootstrap 5 to create the toggle menu for the main navbar and also got familiar with variables and understood better how media queries work.


### What should I focus on in the future to improve my skills (how can I become a better programmer)?
I will use Bootstrap again in my next projects (even if I'm also curious about Tailwind too) so that I can get used to it, and in the meantime I also want to focus on using css preprocessors SASS/LESS.
